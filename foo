I often tried to learn the great Emacs editor/IDE/operating system. The last time I tried it, I spent some time getting comfortable with it until I wanted to customize my .emacs file.

That was the point when I entered vi .emacs. As soon as I realized what I’ve done, I knew that Vim has won me over a long time ago.

So, here I am – using Vim as my editor1 of choice.

Another big motivational boost came after I discovered that my preferred shell (ZSH) has an awesome vi-mode including the command mode (yes, you can switch between command and insert mode!).

Vim has a great deal of features, and learning them takes some time. Of course there are many online-tutorials and tips’n’tricks pages, but the help-files are very good too! There are overview-pages, summary pages and some comments at the commands.

I took the approach to start using some tutorial and let the help-system guide (type :help <command> to get help for the command) me through the rest. I like to try the commands in a test-file, and take a short note of important commands.

Another reason I like to use Vim is because it’s much more healthy than Emacs (using the default-keymappings). Healthy? Many commands are easily typed with a single keystroke – the virtue of a modal editor, instead of long command-chains with lots of modifier keys. Even if you have a natural keyboard, pressing Ctrl, Alt etc is certainly not natural at all.

Just remember: Vim’s basics are really very simple, but in combination the simple commands become very powerful.
